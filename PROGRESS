March 11, 2025:
- Set up development environment with Fedora
- Read through glibc testing documentation
- Created initial test structure

March 12, 2025
- Implemented file operations in each thread
- Refactored code to use more functions
- Improved error handling
- Added basic MT-safety test where each thread opens a unique file with a unique ID
- Added errno checking
- Would use xpthread_create if developing for glibc directly
- Found https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/master/iconv/tst-iconv-mt.c that looks much simpler than my test, which led me to simplify my approach
- Removed half the code; simplification might be the key

March 13, 2025
- Refactored code to be more verbose with better error reporting
- Studied iconv MT test for inspiration
- Validated that my approach is sound for testing MT-Safety
- Added proper error prefixes (error:, info:) following glibc conventions
- Further refactored code to better follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Split test_basic_mtsafety into three specialized functions:
  * run_file_creation_test
  * run_nonexistent_file_test
  * run_file_verification_test
- Simplified error handling by removing goto statements
- Removed redundant result variable for cleaner flow control
- Final review shows code now better adheres to SOLID principles

March 14, 2025
- Removed unnecessary comments to improve code readability
- Eliminated redundant file handling code
- Ensured each function properly cleans up its own resources
- Removed check for nonexistent file deletion as it's not required
- Reviewed code against glibc style guidelines for final submission
- Tested with various thread counts to ensure robustness
- Replaced fscanf verification with direct string comparison for more robust tests

March 15-16, 2025 (Weekend)

- Reviewed multi-threaded test implementation
- Validated test configuration:
- Confirmed 64 threads
- Verified 100 iterations per thread
- Prepared documentation
- Investigated ThreadSanitizer integration
- Added troubleshooting guidance for memory mapping issues

Key Challenges Overcome

- Ensuring thread isolation
- Implementing robust error checking
- Managing file operations across multiple concurrent threads
- Developing a test that can reliably detect MT-safety issues

Lessons Learned

- Simplification is crucial in multi-threaded testing
- Careful error handling is key to robust thread-safe code
- Using barriers helps synchronize thread execution
- ThreadSanitizer is invaluable for detecting subtle threading issues

Future Improvements

- Consider additional edge cases
- Potentially increase thread and iteration counts
- Explore more complex file operation scenarios
