March 11, 2025:
- Set up development environment with Fedora
- Read through glibc testing documentation
- Created initial test structure

- Implemented file operations in each thread
- Refactor code to use more functions
- Improved error handling
- Adding basic MT-safety every thread opens unique file with unique id
- Adding errno checking
- I would use xpthread_create if developing for glibc directly
- I found https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/master/iconv/tst-iconv-mt.c that looks much easier than my test, so I might simplify it too.
- Half code removed, simplification might be the key
